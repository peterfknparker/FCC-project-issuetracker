# Custom admin panel / redeveloped front end and API

## User Stories

1. You can send a POST request to `/api/issues/{projectname}` with form data containing the required fields issue_title, issue_text, created_by, and optionally assigned_to and status_text.

2. The POST request to `/api/issues/{projectname}` will return the created object, and must include all of the submitted fields. Excluded optional fields will be returned as empty strings. Additionally, include created_on `(date/time)`, updated_on `(date/time)`, open `(boolean, true for open - default value, false for closed)`, and \_id.

3. If you send a POST request to `/api/issues/{projectname}` without the required fields, returned will be the error `{ error: 'required field(s) missing' }`

4. You can send a GET request to `/api/issues/{projectname}` for an array of all issues for that specific projectname, with all the fields present for each issue.

5. You can send a GET request to `/api/issues/{projectname}` and filter the request by also passing along any field and value as a URL query `(ie. /api/issues/{project}?open=false)`. You can pass one or more field/value pairs at once.

6. You can send a PUT request to `/api/issues/{projectname}` with an \_id and one or more fields to update. On success, the updated_on field should be updated, and returned should be `{ result: 'successfully updated', '_id': _id }`.

7. When the PUT request sent to `/api/issues/{projectname}` does not include an \_id, the return value is `{ error: 'missing _id' }`.

8. When the PUT request sent to `/api/issues/{projectname}` does not include update fields, the return value is `{ error: 'no update field(s) sent', '_id': _id }`. On any other error, the return value is `{ error: 'could not update', '_id': _id }`.

9. You can send a DELETE request to `/api/issues/{projectname}` with an \_id to delete an issue. If no \_id is sent, the return value is `{ error: 'missing _id' }`. On success, the return value is `{ result: 'successfully deleted', '_id': _id }`. On failure, the return value is `{ error: 'could not delete', '_id': _id }`.

10. All 14 functional tests are complete and passing.
